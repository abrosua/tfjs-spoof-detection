## Contents

This demo shows how to use the Blazeface model to detect faces in a video stream. Then the face image(s) will be cropped and parsed to the classification model

## Setup

First, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable) on your machine, with the corresponding operating system, to build and/or run the app.
 
Install dependencies and prepare the build directory:

```sh
yarn
```

Launching the development server (by default, it's running at http://localhost:1234) :

```sh
yarn watch
